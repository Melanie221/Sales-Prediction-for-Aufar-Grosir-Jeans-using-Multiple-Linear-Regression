# Sales-Prediction-for-Aufar-Grosir-Jeans-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
This project predicts sales at Aufar Grosir Jeans on Shopee using a multiple linear regression model. By analyzing key factors such as sold products and shipping discount incentives, we developed an accurate sales forecast model. The methodology follows the SEMMA process—sampling, exploring, modifying, modeling, and assessing data—to ensure robust predictions and actionable insights.

## Dataset used
-  <a href="https://github.com/Melanie221/BikeSales_Dashboard/blob/main/Bike%20sales%20dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Project Objectives
- Develop a predictive sales model using multiple linear regression.
- Identify the impact of sold products and shipping discounts on total sales.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for inventory and marketing strategies.

## Key Questions & KPIs for Analysis
- Total Sales Volume – How many products were sold?
- Impact of Discounts – How do shipping discounts influence sales?
- Revenue Forecasting – What is the projected sales revenue for upcoming months?
- Model Accuracy – How well does the regression model predict sales performance?

## Tools Used
- Python – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- SPSS – Performing multiple linear regression analysis and statistical tests.

 ## Analysis Process
- Data Collection – Gather sales data from Shopee.
- Data Cleaning (Python) – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Python) – Identify key trends and correlations.
- Regression Modeling (SPSS) – Perform multiple linear regression analysis.
- Model Evaluation (SPSS) – Validate the model using statistical tests and accuracy metrics.
= Insights & Reporting – Interpret results and provide strategic recommendations.

## Project Insights & Conclusion
- Sales volume is significantly influenced by the number of sold products, while shipping discounts have a smaller but positive effect.
- The regression model achieved high accuracy (MAPE = 8.99%), making it reliable for sales forecasting.
- Business strategies should focus on increasing product sales volume and optimizing discount incentives to boost revenue​
